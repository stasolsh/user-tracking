## üéØ Objective

The microservice is responsible for storing and processing user actions. This microservice has APIs that are both imperative and reactive. Data persists in MongoDB.

## üèÉ Running the project

You should have a **Docker** environment with support to **Docker Compose**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _This project uses batch and bash scripts to make some commands easier to run._

Open your terminal in the root folder and type:

```batch
 cd docker-local
 run.bat
```

```bash
./docker-local/run.sh
```

This script will build a .jar artifact, build your images, and launch all containers.

To stop running containers, just type:

```batch
cd docker-local
stop.bat
```

```bash
./docker-local/stop.sh
```

and all your containers will be dropped and volumes will be removed.

## üìö API Documentation

All endpoints were documented using Swagger 3 for Spring Boot 3. All you have to do is open [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs) and give it a go.
